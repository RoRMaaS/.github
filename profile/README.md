# RoRMaaS

[RoRMaaS](https://www.rormaas.com/) is a maintenance service for Ruby on Rails applications provided by [Narnach](https://www.narnach.com). We provide three services:

- [Ruby on Rails maintenance](https://www.rormaas.com/maintenance.html) which saves teams 10-15 hours per month by handling weekly dependency updates and keeping an eye on CI Pipeline health
- [Ruby on Rails upgrades](https://www.rormaas.com/rails_upgrades.html) to help teams upgrade to a version of Rails that's currently maintained. If you're not yet on Rails 6 you need this.
- [CI Pipeline optimization](https://www.rormaas.com/ci_pipeline.html) to help teams waste less time waiting for a slow CI run. If your CI takes more than 10 minutes to run, you'll benefit from this. This one is No Cure, No Pay.

Our Github organization contains tools we use and projects we've forked on behalf of our clients to extend maintenance or combine PRs that have not yet been released in an official release.
